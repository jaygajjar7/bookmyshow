## Installation

We can start developing our application to display the data. Create a new project folder called 'Bookmyshow' and then cd into the folder via the terminal and execute these commands:

```bash
pyenv local 3.9.0 
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate 
pip install --upgrade pip [ this is optional]
```

So after getting this done we have to install basic libraries

```bash
pip install Django
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver 
```
